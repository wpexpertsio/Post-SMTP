== Description ==

= Version 2.0 released - Mailer Type =
[Read the detailes here](https://postmansmtp.com/post-smtp-2-0-mailer-type-and-much-more/)

= The Only SMTP plugin with chrome Notifications = 
Get notified if your emails are failing inside your Chrome browser. [Download here](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/post-smtp-notifications/npklmbkpbknkmbohdbpikeidiaekjoch?hl=en-US)

= WordPress Mail SMTP Plugin =

= Postman SMTP is back! =
No need to search for another SMTP plugin anymore.

Post SMTP is a next-generation WP Mail SMTP plugin, that assists in the delivery of email generated by your WordPress site. Post SMTP is the first and only plugin to support the [latest security standards](http://googleonlinesecurity.blogspot.ca/2014/04/new-security-measures-will-affect-older.html). With OAuth 2.0, there is **no need** to [store your email passsword](http://blog.codinghorror.com/youre-probably-storing-passwords-incorrectly/) in the WordPress database where it might be found.

The **Connectivity Test** and intelligent **Setup Wizard** scan your SMTP server to detect firewall blocks and eliminate configuration mistakes. The built-in **Email Log** is an invaluable resource for [diagnosing problems](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/ugly-e-mails-no-html-and-no-special-characters?replies=15) with emails. Even hosts that block the standard SMTP ports, like GoDaddy or Bluehost, can't stop your email as **Post SMTP can deliver via HTTPS** if it can't use SMTP.

Post SMTP is *not* another WP Mail SMTP clone like WP Bank or Easy SMTP. It replaces the default WordPress SMTP library, PHPMailer, with the heavy-duty Zend_Mail. Never [lose an email to PHP mail()](http://www.jvfconsulting.com/blog/php-mail-function-vs-smtp-guaranteed-delivery/) again.

= The Most Fast And Easy =
See how fast and easy to setup Post SMTP with Google/Gsuite or any SMTP service.

= CREDITS =

Post SMTP (aka Postman SMTP) plugin was originally created by Jason Hendriks.

== Installation ==

> To send email reliably, you must use the SMTP server assigned to that email. If Post is unable to connect to the right SMTP server, you may have to ask your host to open the ports, or create a new email account managed by your host, or switch hosts!
> 
> The Connectivity Test utility will tell you which ports are open and the actions available to you.

= Easy install and setup! (Recommended for all users) =
1. Install and activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
1. In the WordPress 'Settings' menu select 'Post SMTP'.
1. Choose 'Start the Wizard' and follow the instructions.

> Post is developed on OS X with PHP 5.5.14 and Apache 2.4.9. Post is tested in a [Red Hat OpenShift](http://www.openshift.com/) environment with PHP 5.3.3 and Apache 2.2.15 with Gmail, Hotmail and Yahoo Mail (US). Post is tested with [mailtrap.io](http://mailtrap.io).



== Frequently Asked Questions == 

= Where is Postman SMTP? =
From 2015-11-08 more or less I can say that Jason the original author stoped maintain the plugin.
He may still answered some support tickets, but nothing more.

You can read more about the "story" here:
https://postmansmtp.com/#story


= What is OAuth 2.0? =

A modern replacement for traditional password-based authentication. Post supports the OAuth 2.0 implementations of all three major e-mail providers: Gmail, Hotmail and Yahoo Mail.

= How does OAuth 2.0 work? =

Post requests a limited access OAuth 2.0 token (valet key) to access the APIs (enter the house) and perform a specific service (handle Gmail, stay out of Google Docs) with no need for you to surrender your username and password credentials (master house key).

Once access is granted, Post commandeers the WordPress wp_mail() function to provide an incredibly stable mail sub-system.

= Can't I just tell Google to allow less secure apps and keep using my old password? =

Google does have a setting to [allow less secure apps](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/6010255) but this option is [not available](http://plugins.svn.wordpress.org/Post-smtp/assets/Screen%20Shot%202015-02-21%20at%208.52.13%20PM.png) if you're using *Google Apps* to manage a domain.

There are many reasons why OAuth 2.0 is better than any password-based mechanism:

* Post will never ask for your password, so your password can't be stolen
* If you change your password regularly, you will never have to update Post's configuration
* You have tighter control over the data Post has access to. For Google users it can never access your Calendar or Docs or YouTube; for Yahoo users it can never access your Flickr
* If your WordPress site gets hacked, you can revoke Post's email access without impacting any other application or website that has access to your account

> **[NEVER give out your Gmail, Microsoft or Yahoo password](http://blog.varonis.com/giving-away-your-passwords/)** to a 3rd-party or 3rd-party program that you don't fully trust.

= What is a Client ID? =
To use OAuth, your website needs it's own Client ID. The Client ID is used to control authentication and authorization and is tied to the specific URL of your website. If you manage several websites, you will need a different Client ID for each one.

= How do I get a Google Client ID? (For Gmail users only!) =
Go to [Configure Post SMTP with Gmail\Gsuite OAuth](https://postmansmtp.com/how-to-configure-post-smtp-with-gmailgsuite-using-oauth/)

= How do I get a Microsoft Client ID? (For Hotmail/Live/Outlook.com users only!) =
1. Go to [Microsoft account Developer Center](https://account.live.com/developers/applications/index) and select 'Create application'.
1. In the 'Application name' field enter 'Post SMTP'. Select 'I accept.'
1. Select 'API Settings' from under 'Settings'.
1. In 'Redirect URL', enter the redirect URI given by Post (either from the wizard, or from the manual configuration page). Select Save.
1. Select 'App Settings' from under 'Settings'.
1. Enter the Client ID and Client Secret displayed here into Post's settings page.

= How do I get a Yahoo Client ID? (For Yahoo Mail users only!) =
1. Go to [Yahoo Developer Network](https://developer.yahoo.com/apps/) and select 'Create an App'.
1. In the 'Application Name' field enter 'Post SMTP'. For 'Application Type' choose 'Web Application'.
1. In 'Home Page URL', enter the 'Home Page URL' given by Post.
1. In 'Callback Domain', enter the 'Callback Domain' given by Post.
1. Under 'API Permissions' choose 'Mail'. Under 'Mail' choose 'Read/Write'
1. Click 'Create App'
1. Enter the Client ID and Client Secret displayed here into Post's settings page.

= How can I revoke Post's OAuth 2.0 access? =
* If you have a Google Account, from the [Google Developer's Console](https://www.google.com/accounts/Logout?continue=https://console.developers.google.com) use the Delete button under the Client ID.
* If you have a Microsoft Live account, from the [Microsoft account Developer Center](https://account.live.com/developers/applications/index), select the Application and choose Delete Application.
* If you have a Yahoo Account, from the [Yahoo Developer Network My Apps](https://developer.yahoo.com/apps/), select the Application and choose Delete App. 



== Grant OAuth permission error messages ==

Please note that the Client ID and Client Secret fields are NOT for your username and password. They are for OAuth Credentials only.

= Error authenticating with this Client ID. [Error executing wp_remote_post: The user has blocked requests via HTTP.] =

Your WordPress site is configured with WP_HTTP_BLOCK_EXTERNAL to prevent outbound connections. Add a whitelist rule to wp-config.php:
> define('WP_ACCESSIBLE_HOSTS', 'www.googleapis.com, login.live.com, api.login.yahoo.com');

= Error authenticating with this Client ID. [Error executing wp_remote_post: Failed to connect to xxxx] =

There is a firewall on port 443 between you and the OAuth2 server. Open up the port for outbound connections.

= Error: redirect_uri_mismatch =

* You did not enter the Redirect URI correctly, watch the [instructional video](https://vimeo.com/128589255)
* You used an IP address instead of a domain name (not allowed)

= Error: invalid_client ... no support email =

You've [forgotten to choose an email address in the consent screen](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/status-Post-is-not-sending-mail-1?replies=7).


== SMTP Error Messages ==

= Communication Error [334] – make sure the Envelope From Email is the same account used to create the Client ID. =

* This is almost always caused by being logged in to Google/Microsoft/Yahoo with a different user than the one Post is configured to send mail with. Logout and try again with the correct user
* Login to [Webmail](http://www.gmail.com) and see if there is an "Unusual Activity" warning waiting for your attention

= Could not open socket =

* Your host may have installed a firewall between you and the server. Ask them to open the ports.
* Your may have tried to (incorrectly) use SSL over port 587. Check your encryption and port settings.

= Operation Timed out =

* Your host may have poor connectivity to the mail server. Try doubling the Read Timeout.
* Your host may have installed a firewall (DROP packets) between you and the server. Ask them to open the ports.
* Your may have tried to (incorrectly) use TLS over port 465. Check your encryption and port settings.

= Connection refused =

Your host has likely installed a firewall (REJECT packets) between you and the server. Ask them to open the ports.

= 503 Bad sequence of commands =

You configured TLS security when you should have selected no security.

= XOAUTH2 authentication mechanism not supported =

You may be on a Virtual Private Server that is [playing havoc with your communications](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/oh-bother-xoauth2-authentication-mechanism-not-supported?replies=9). Jump ship.


== Mail ends up in the Spam folder ==

To avoid being flagged as spam, you need to prove your email isn't forged. On a custom domain, its up to YOU to set that up:

* Ensure you are using the correct SMTP server with authentication - the correct SMTP server is the one defined by your email service's SPF record
* If you use a custom domain name for email, add an [SPF record](http://www.openspf.org/Introduction) to your DNS zone file. The SPF is specific to your email provider, for example [Google](https://support.google.com/a/answer/33786)
* If you use a custom domain name for email, add a DKIM record to your DNS zone file and upload your Domain Key (a digital signature) to, for example [Google]((https://support.google.com/a/answer/174124?hl=en))

Lovely. Well this change should eliminate all the "update doesn't work!" bugs for good.

* Commercial-grade improvements to Connectivity Test and Setup Wizard. The new wizard prevents misconfiguration by interrogating the MTA for capabilities and intelligently suggests the best settings for the user. Steve Jobs would be proud.

* Fixed Wizard's MSA hostname guess for Outlook 365 addresses (smtp.live.com is for their free Hotmail service)
* Added French/Italian translation for JQuery Validation

= 1.5.10 - 2015-03-29 =
* Fix for Fatal error: Cannot redeclare class PEAR_Common in C:\PHP5\PEAR\PEAR\Common.php - similar to [this error](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/plugin-wp-minify-cant-activate-plugin-fatal-error?replies=6) in WP Minify

* In the wizard, if no ports are available for use, the error message was not being displayed.

= 1.5 - 2015-02-22 =
* [[Ticket](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/oh-bother-connection-refused?replies=12)|[Ticket](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/impossible-to-send-mail?replies=6)] Added support for modular transports. The first external transport is the Post Gmail Extension, which uses the Gmail API to send mail out on the HTTPS port, a convenient way around traditional TCP port blocks for Gmail users
* [[Ticket](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/display-error-on-plugin-activation?replies=33)] Made my debug logging "less agressive" so that broken systems (those that pipe warning messages to STDOUT regardless of the WordPress WP_DEBUG_DISPLAY setting or PHP's display_errors settings) will no longer experience the Port Test hanging during a check

* [[Ticket](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/display-error-on-plugin-activation?replies=33)] Suppressed warning messages generated by calls to fsockopen - they were causing the remote Ajax queries to hang
* The wizard was resetting some settings by accident, namely Connection Timeout, Read Timeout and Reply-To
* [[Ticket](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/display-error-on-plugin-activation?replies=33)] Found an environment where calls to error_log were being displayed in the HTML even after display_errors was disabled. Therefore, disabled error_log calls by default. The log may be re-enabled in Advanced Settings
* The Bad, Post! screen was messing with the Port Test Ajax call when fsockopen generated an error and debug level is set to E_ALL in php.ini. Therefore added a switch in the configuration "Show Error Screen" that is off by default. When it is off, Port Test works perfect but errors generate a WSOD. When it is on, errors are displayed in the "Bad, Post!" screen but Port Test fails.
* I heard that some hosts, like WPEngine, do not allow writing to the Http Session. Well that's balls. I've modified the code to write to the database instead.

= 1.3.4 - 2015-02-11 =

* Replaced the Google OAuth API with pure PHP code. No more unexpected Google API errors.

* Fixed a couple minor database upgrade bugs: for new users who use Password Authentication, and for old users that don't have an expiry token stored
* Added a version shortcode, mostly for promotion of Post on my own websites
* Serveal minor tweaks to the user interface, including focus, style, validation, and enabling/disabling inputs where applicable

= 1.3.2 - 2015-02-10 =
* [[Ticket](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/contact-7-and-activation-error?replies=16)] Fixed the error: PHP Fatal error:  Call to private PostAuthorizationToken::__construct() This occurs when upgrading from a pre-v1.0 version of Post (when PostAuthorizationToken had a public constructor) to v1.0 or higher

* Clarified text in 'Run a Port Test' so people won't continue to ask me about connection problems (hopefully)

= 1.2 - 2015-02-04 =
* Support for Sender Name and Reply-To. Turns out Google no longer honours the MUA Return-Path header due to Spam. Makes sense, so I've decided not to add a Return-Path field to Post's configuration.
* Support for WordPress filters [wp_mail_from](http://codex.wordpress.org/Plugin_API/Filter_Reference/wp_mail_from) and [wp_mail_from_name](http://codex.wordpress.org/Plugin_API/Filter_Reference/wp_mail_from_name)

* [[Ticket](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/call-to-undefined-function-str_getcsv?replies=12)] Fixed "Fatal error: Call to undefined function str_getcsv()". Thanks to user micb for catching ths one. This function is not available before PHP 5.3. Fixed by replacing str_getdsv() with custom implementation.

= 0.1 - 2015-01-19 =
