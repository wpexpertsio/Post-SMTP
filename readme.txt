= WordPress Mail SMTP Plugin =

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDmwPG-RmDc

Post SMTP is a next-generation WP Mail SMTP plugin that assists and improves the email deliverability process of your WordPress website. 

**Easy-to-use and reliable** - 300,000+ customers trust Post SMTP Mailer to send their daily WordPress emails to millions of users worldwide.  

Post SMTP is not another WP Mail SMTP clone like WP Bank or Easy SMTP. It helps provide authentication that makes sure your emails get delivered and don't end up in the spam filter or worse, the undelivered email queue.

Post SMTP replaces the default WordPress SMTP library, PHPMailer, with the heavy-duty Zend_Mail - **Never lose an email to PHP mail() again.**

= What makes Post SMTP the best WP Mail SMTP plugin? =
* Post SMTP's intelligent setup wizard helps guide you each and every step of the way from getting started to sending test emails. 
* The connectivity test scans your SMTP server to detect firewall blocks and eliminate configuration mistakes. 
* The built-in Email log is an invaluable resource for diagnosing problems with emails.
* OAuth 2.0 increase the security and protection of email password by discouraging the idea of storing your email password in the WordPress database where it might be found.

Even hosts that block the standard SMTP ports, like GoDaddy or Bluehost, can't stop your email as Post SMTP can deliver via HTTPS if it can't use SMTP.

= What is SMTP and why do you need it? =
Simple Mail Transfer Protocol or SMTP is the protocol used for sending emails over the internet. Your email client uses SMTP to send a message to a mail server, which then uses SMTP to relay the message to the correct receiving mail server. 

In essence, SMTP is a set of commands that authenticates and directs the transfer of electronic mail. When configuring your email program, you will typically need to set the SMTP server to your local ISP's SMTP settings.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What is OAuth 2.0? =

A modern replacement for traditional password-based authentication. Post supports the OAuth 2.0 implementations of all three major e-mail providers: Gmail, Hotmail and Yahoo Mail.

= How does OAuth 2.0 work? =

Post requests a limited access OAuth 2.0 token (valet key) to access the APIs (enter the house) and perform a specific service (handle Gmail, stay out of Google Docs) with no need for you to surrender your username and password credentials (master house key).

Once access is granted, Post commandeers the WordPress wp_mail() function to provide an incredibly stable mail sub-system.

There are many reasons why OAuth 2.0 is better than any password-based mechanism:

* Post will never ask for your password, so your password can't be stolen
* If you change your password regularly, you will never have to update Post's configuration
* You have tighter control over the data Post has access to. For Google users it can never access your Calendar or Docs or YouTube; for Yahoo users it can never access your Flickr
* If your WordPress site gets hacked, you can revoke Post's email access without impacting any other application or website that has access to your account

> **[NEVER give out your Gmail, Microsoft or Yahoo password](http://blog.varonis.com/giving-away-your-passwords/)** to a 3rd-party or 3rd-party program that you don't fully trust.

= What is a Client ID? =
To use OAuth, your website needs it's own Client ID. The Client ID is used to control authentication and authorization and is tied to the specific URL of your website. If you manage several websites, you will need a different Client ID for each one.

= How do I get a Microsoft Client ID? (For Hotmail/Live/Outlook.com users only!) =
1. Go to [Microsoft account Developer Center](https://account.live.com/developers/applications/index) and select 'Create application'.
1. In the 'Application name' field enter 'Post SMTP'. Select 'I accept.'
1. Select 'API Settings' from under 'Settings'.
1. In 'Redirect URL', enter the redirect URI given by Post (either from the wizard, or from the manual configuration page). Select Save.
1. Select 'App Settings' from under 'Settings'.
1. Enter the Client ID and Client Secret displayed here into Post's settings page.

= How do I get a Yahoo Client ID? (For Yahoo Mail users only!) =
1. Go to [Yahoo Developer Network](https://developer.yahoo.com/apps/) and select 'Create an App'.
1. In the 'Application Name' field enter 'Post SMTP'. For 'Application Type' choose 'Web Application'.
1. In 'Home Page URL', enter the 'Home Page URL' given by Post.
1. In 'Callback Domain', enter the 'Callback Domain' given by Post.
1. Under 'API Permissions' choose 'Mail'. Under 'Mail' choose 'Read/Write'
1. Click 'Create App'
1. Enter the Client ID and Client Secret displayed here into Post's settings page.

= How can I revoke Post's OAuth 2.0 access? =
* If you have a Google Account, from the [Google Developer's Console](https://www.google.com/accounts/Logout?continue=https://console.developers.google.com) use the Delete button under the Client ID.
* If you have a Microsoft Live account, from the [Microsoft account Developer Center](https://account.live.com/developers/applications/index), select the Application and choose Delete Application.
* If you have a Yahoo Account, from the [Yahoo Developer Network My Apps](https://developer.yahoo.com/apps/), select the Application and choose Delete App.

= How can I report security bugs? =
You can report security bugs through the Patchstack Vulnerability Disclosure Program. The Patchstack team help validate, triage and handle any security vulnerabilities. [Report a security vulnerability.](https://patchstack.com/database/vulnerability/post-smtp)

== Grant OAuth permission error messages ==

Please note that the Client ID and Client Secret fields are NOT for your username and password. They are for OAuth Credentials only.

= Error authenticating with this Client ID. [Error executing wp_remote_post: The user has blocked requests via HTTP.] =

Your WordPress site is configured with WP_HTTP_BLOCK_EXTERNAL to prevent outbound connections. Add a whitelist rule to wp-config.php:
> define('WP_ACCESSIBLE_HOSTS', 'www.googleapis.com, login.live.com, api.login.yahoo.com');

= Error authenticating with this Client ID. [Error executing wp_remote_post: Failed to connect to xxxx] =

There is a firewall on port 443 between you and the OAuth2 server. Open up the port for outbound connections.

= Error: redirect_uri_mismatch =

* You did not enter the Redirect URI correctly.
* You used an IP address instead of a domain name (not allowed)

== SMTP Error Messages ==

= Communication Error 334 make sure the Envelope From Email is the same account used to create the Client ID. =

* This is almost always caused by being logged in to Google/Microsoft/Yahoo with a different user than the one Post is configured to send mail with. Logout and try again with the correct user
* Login to [Webmail](http://www.gmail.com) and see if there is an "Unusual Activity" warning waiting for your attention

= Could not open socket =

* Your host may have installed a firewall between you and the server. Ask them to open the ports.
* Your may have tried to (incorrectly) use SSL over port 587. Check your encryption and port settings.

= Operation Timed out =

* Your host may have poor connectivity to the mail server. Try doubling the Read Timeout.
* Your host may have installed a firewall (DROP packets) between you and the server. Ask them to open the ports.
* Your may have tried to (incorrectly) use TLS over port 465. Check your encryption and port settings.

= Connection refused =

Your host has likely installed a firewall (REJECT packets) between you and the server. Ask them to open the ports.

= 503 Bad sequence of commands =

You configured TLS security when you should have selected no security.

= XOAUTH2 authentication mechanism not supported =

You may be on a Virtual Private Server that is [playing havoc with your communications](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/oh-bother-xoauth2-authentication-mechanism-not-supported?replies=9). Jump ship.

== Mail ends up in the Spam folder ==

To avoid being flagged as spam, you need to prove your email isn't forged. On a custom domain, its up to YOU to set that up:

* Ensure you are using the correct SMTP server with authentication - the correct SMTP server is the one defined by your email service's SPF record
* If you use a custom domain name for email, add an SPF record to your DNS zone file. The SPF is specific to your email provider.
* If you use a custom domain name for email, add a DKIM record to your DNS zone file and upload your Domain Key (a digital signature).
