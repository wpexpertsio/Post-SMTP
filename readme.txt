Are you facing the WordPress not sending emails issue? Don't worry! Install the Post SMTP Plugin for smooth WordPress email deliverability.

Over **300,000** website owners use **Post SMTP** daily to send WordPress emails securely and reliably💯.

Post SMTP is a free and next-generation WordPress SMTP plugin that has everything you need to improve the email deliverability of your WordPress site.

The best part is that the Post SMTP plugin helps you configure any SMTP mailer with proper authentication that guarantees the delivery of your WordPress emails and prevents them from being marked as spam.

With the [Post SMTP Pro version](https://postmansmtp.com/pricing/?utm_source=wp_org&utm_medium=read_me), you can unlock even more advanced features, such as detailed email logging, email delivery stats and reporting, Microsoft 365, Amazon SES, Zoho SMTP integration, multiple email failure alert options, and more.

== What is SMTP, and Why Do You Need It? ==
**SMTP**, short for Simple Mail Transfer Protocol, is the most widely used protocol for online email transmission. SMTP configuration with proper authentication for your WordPress site ensures that your WordPress emails do not end up in spam.

**By default**, WordPress sends emails using the PHP mail function, which isn't ideal because most WordPress hosting servers don't support PHP email.

On top of that, most email clients, such as Outlook (Microsoft 365), Yahoo, Gmail, Zoho, etc., automatically block or mark spam emails that lack proper authentication.

That’s why you need to install the Post SMTP plugin on your WordPress site to configure the SMTP mailer of your choice.

== How Does Post SMTP Work? ==
Post SMTP allows you to easily replace the default PHP mail function (wp_mail) of your WordPress site with the SMTP mailer of your choice, like [Microsoft 365](https://postmansmtp.com/extensions/office-365-extension-for-post-smtp/?utm_source=wp_org&utm_medium=read_me), Brevo, Zoho, Gmail, Post Mark, etc., which in turn improves WordPress email deliverability.

Additionally, with a [3-step setup wizard](https://postmansmtp.com/introducing-the-new-3-step-setup-wizard-for-post-smtp/?utm_source=wp_org&utm_medium=read_me) using OAuth (open authentication), you can configure any SMTP mailer securely via API Keys in seconds without providing your SMTP account credentials.

Ultimately, the Post SMTP helps you fix all your issues related to [WordPress not sending emails.](https://postmansmtp.com/wordpress-not-sending-emails/?utm_source=wp_org&utm_medium=read_me)

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What is OAuth 2.0? =

A modern replacement for traditional password-based authentication. Post supports the OAuth 2.0 implementations of all three major e-mail providers: Gmail, Hotmail and Yahoo Mail.

= How does OAuth 2.0 work? =

Post requests a limited access OAuth 2.0 token (valet key) to access the APIs (enter the house) and perform a specific service (handle Gmail, stay out of Google Docs) with no need for you to surrender your username and password credentials (master house key).

Once access is granted, Post commandeers the WordPress wp_mail() function to provide an incredibly stable mail sub-system.

There are many reasons why OAuth 2.0 is better than any password-based mechanism:

* Post will never ask for your password, so your password can't be stolen
* If you change your password regularly, you will never have to update Post's configuration
* You have tighter control over the data Post has access to. For Google users, it can never access your Calendar or Docs or YouTube; for Yahoo users, it can never access your Flickr
* If your WordPress site gets hacked, you can revoke Post's email access without impacting any other application or website that has access to your account

> **[NEVER give out your Gmail, Microsoft or Yahoo password](http://blog.varonis.com/giving-away-your-passwords/)** to a 3rd-party or 3rd-party program that you don't fully trust.

= Can I use this plugin to send via Outlook, Microsoft 365, Gmail, Zoho, Yahoo, or SendGrid SMTP? =
Yes! With the Post SMTP Plugin, you can configure any SMTP mailer account with your WordPress site. Check out our [detailed SMTP configuration documentation](https://postmansmtp.com/documentation/sockets-addons/?utm_source=wp_org&utm_medium=read_me) for all major SMTP service providers.

= What is a Client ID? =
To use OAuth, your website needs its own Client ID. The Client ID is used to control authentication and authorization and is tied to the specific URL of your website. If you manage several websites, you will need a different Client ID for each one.

= How do I get a Microsoft Client ID? (For Hotmail/Live/Outlook.com users only!) =
1. Go to [Microsoft account Developer Center](https://account.live.com/developers/applications/index) and select 'Create application'.
1. In the 'Application name' field, enter 'Post SMTP'. Select 'I accept.'
1. Select 'API Settings' from under 'Settings'.
1. In 'Redirect URL', enter the redirect URI given by Post (either from the wizard or from the manual configuration page). Select Save.
1. Select 'App Settings' from under 'Settings'.
1. Enter the Client ID and Client Secret displayed here into the Post's settings page.

= How do I get a Yahoo Client ID? (For Yahoo Mail users only!) =
1. Go to [Yahoo Developer Network](https://developer.yahoo.com/apps/) and select 'Create an App'.
1. In the 'Application Name' field, enter 'Post SMTP'. For 'Application Type', choose 'Web Application'.
1. In 'Home Page URL', enter the 'Home Page URL' given by Post.
1. In 'Callback Domain', enter the 'Callback Domain' given by Post.
1. Under 'API Permissions', choose 'Mail.' Under 'Mail' choose 'Read/Write'
1. Click 'Create App'
1. Enter the Client ID and Client Secret displayed here into the Post's settings page.

= How can I revoke Post's OAuth 2.0 access? =
* If you have a Google Account from the [Google Developer's Console](https://www.google.com/accounts/Logout?continue=https://console.developers.google.com), use the Delete button under the Client ID.

* If you have a Microsoft Live account, from the [Microsoft account Developer Center](https://account.live.com/developers/applications/index), select the Application and choose Delete Application.

* If you have a Yahoo Account, from the [Yahoo Developer Network My Apps](https://developer.yahoo.com/apps/), select the Application and choose Delete App.

= How can I report security bugs? =
You can report security bugs through the Patchstack Vulnerability Disclosure Program. The Patchstack team helps validate, triage, and handle any security vulnerabilities. [Report a security vulnerability.](https://patchstack.com/database/vulnerability/post-smtp)
